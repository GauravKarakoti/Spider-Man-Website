        <h2>Creation And Development</h2>
        <p>
            In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was
            casting for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage 
            demand for comic books and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify. As with 
            Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get out of his system" what he 
            felt was missing in comic books.
